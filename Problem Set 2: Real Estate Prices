# Your co-worker at DataScienster comes up to you and asks for your help. 
# She would like to buy a 1-bedroom apartment in the city, and she has a preferred area she likes.
# She has managed to collect some data for the listings (asking price and sold) in that zip code (see your data set).
# Her questions are: 
# 1. What's the average price for a 1 BD place?
# 2. What's the average price for a 2 BD place?
# 3. (bonus question) Is Esprit Park cheaper than other places in the neighborhood for a 1 BD?

# Step 1: create your lists of prices: 1 list for 1 BD, 1 list for 2 BD 
# hint 1: see lists in Python
# your code goes here:

# Step 2: calculate the sum of prices in each list (see sum in Python)
# hint 2: see sum() in Python
# your code goes here:

# Step 3: calculate the length of each list
# hint 3: see len(), see float() in Python
# your code goes here:

# Step 4: calculate the average for each list, print it out
# hint 4: look at numpy.mean function, np.array().mean()
# your code goes here
